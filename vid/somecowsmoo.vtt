00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.260
Some cows moo

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.360
This is a restricted existential generalization

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.090
We're not just saying that

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.520
Something moose

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.990
We're saying that some cow

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.850
Moves

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.180
Me

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.220


00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.200
Way to capture a restricted

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.470
Existential generalization

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.170
Is

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.680
Like this

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.090
Some exercises that X is a cow

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.170
Hand

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.070
Hacks

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.080
Moose

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.640


00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.890
It's a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.830
Existential generalization

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.460
Governing a conjunction

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.960
Telling us that there is at least one thing

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.920
And that thing

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.600
Is a cow

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.350
And that thing

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.960
Moose

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.780
So

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.120
Some cows moo

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.410
There's at least one thing such that both it is a cow

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.870
And it moves
