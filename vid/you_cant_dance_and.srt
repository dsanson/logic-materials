1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,516
Our sentence is you can't dance and

2
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:08,322
it is not safe to dance

3
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:12,412
So I'm going to replace you can't dance

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:16,135
with the negation of you can dance so

5
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:19,859
you can dance is our and so you

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,582
can't dance is not our since we don't

7
00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:27,306
have the negation symbol on our keyboard
we

8
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:31,029
will use the tilde to type in a

9
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,753
negation until December is usually above
your tab

10
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:38,476
key on the left hand side of your

11
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:42,200
keyboard and just underneath your Escape
key

12
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:46,932
You can't dance and it is not safe to
dance

13
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:50,884
that is the negation of it is safe to

14
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,836
dance which is s so that is not s

15
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:58,659
And finally the

16
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,415
conjunction and is

17
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:04,172
best and Junction

18
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,329
You can't dance and it is

19
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,919
not safe to dance is translated

20
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:15,509
into not are and not s
