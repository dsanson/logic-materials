00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:08.718
You are asked: Suppose you have 

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:11.727
"not not R" as a premise.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.032
What follows from that

00:00:14.032 --> 00:00:16.216
by Double Negation Elimination?

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:20.006
Double Negation Elimination is the
rule 

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.370
that says that when your premise is

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.734
a double negation, you can infer the double
negated sentence---

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:30.098
the sentence without those two
nots.

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:33.461
In this case, the answer is simply "R".

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:37.703
So I type in "R", and then,

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:41.455
just like with the translation questions,
I type "Enter",

00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:45.206
and it says "Perfect match!" 

00:00:45.206 --> 00:00:48.958
Then I can click submit,
and it gives me credit.
