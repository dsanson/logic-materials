00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:10.080
This time our conclusion is pee there

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.974
were setting out to show pee

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.294
Again I indent I first premise is

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:20.968
if not P then not cute

00:00:21.557 --> 00:00:23.925
The second premise is q

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:27.883
I need to find a way to get e

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:35.222
If I look at line two and line three

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:38.694
I noticed that line 2 is a conditional

00:00:38.964 --> 00:00:41.601
And its consequences not Q

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:44.772
And 93 then

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:49.301
Is what the consequence is a negation of
right

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.259
So you might think

00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.960
I can apply modus tollens lines 2 and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.260
3 and it should give me p

00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:05.965
And you'll notice over here instead of
an ice

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:09.379
plus sign I have an ex if you have

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.793
her over it you'll get the world's least
helpful

00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:16.206
explanation of what's gone wrong
actually that's not true

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:19.620
this is fairly helpful information it's
just it's just

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.033
a bit overwhelming in the way that it's
presented

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:28.229
So what went wrong

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.851
Well modus tollens doesn't

00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:33.251
work like this

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.458
Modus tollens doesn't say that if

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:39.546
you've got a conditional and

00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:42.633
the consequent is a negation

00:01:42.764 --> 00:01:45.041
And your other promise is what

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:47.318
the consequences a negation of

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.205
Then you can infer what the antecedent
does

00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:55.020
a negation up that's not Mota Solon

00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.320
Modus tollens says that if you have a
conditional

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.619
and then another line you have the
negation of

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.918
the consequent in this case the negation
of

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:08.218
not Q then you can apply modus tollens

00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:10.738
Q is not the

00:02:10.738 --> 00:02:13.179
negation of not Q

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.156
Q is the inauguration of not

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:19.133
Q or if you like not

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.110
Q is the negation of Q

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:25.765
The negation of a sentence is what you

00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:28.877
get when you add a negation sign

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.989
to the front of that sent so

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.102
the negation of Q is not Q

00:02:35.103 --> 00:02:38.870
And the negation of not Q is what you
get when

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.636
you add a negation sign to the front of
not cute

00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:46.402
and they gation of not Q is not not cute

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:50.999
If only we had not not Q

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.927
as a premise then we could

00:02:54.927 --> 00:02:58.856
apply modus tollens to line two

00:02:58.857 --> 00:03:00.981
But we don't have not

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.106
knock you we have q

00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:07.609
Is there a way for us to

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.105
get not not Q from Q well

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:14.601
yes there is double negation
introduction gets

00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:18.097
us not knock you from Q

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.877
Now online to I

00:03:21.877 --> 00:03:24.264
have a conditional

00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:27.994
And the consequent is a conditional is

00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:31.724
not q and online for I

00:03:31.724 --> 00:03:35.453
have the negation of that consequent

00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:37.949
This is what I needed in

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.444
order to apply modus tollens

00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:43.039
When I apply modus tollens it's

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.633
not going to give me pee

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:48.970
It's going to give me the negation of

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.307
its antecedent the negation of that
antecedent is

00:03:52.307 --> 00:03:55.645
that antecedent but with an extra not

00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:58.982
sign added to the front so it's

00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:02.319
going to give me not not pee

00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:04.477
By modus tollens from

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.630
2 and 4

00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:10.172
Okay so now I have not not

00:04:10.172 --> 00:04:13.034
pee but I need pee pee

00:04:13.034 --> 00:04:15.895
is what I'm trying to show

00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:19.942
You might think well peeing not not pee

00:04:19.942 --> 00:04:23.808
or logically equivalent so I'm done
director vacation

00:04:23.808 --> 00:04:27.673
line five that's wrong and you'll get an

00:04:27.673 --> 00:04:31.539
A sign up there indicating that it's
wrong

00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:35.170
In order to complete this derivation I

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.573
need to derive the very same sentence

00:04:38.573 --> 00:04:41.975
as the sentence that's on my

00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:44.451
The sentence that's on my show line it's
not enough

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.226
to drive a sentence that is logically
equivalent to that

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.868
I need to drive exactly that sentence

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.826
I need P it's not enough for

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:57.784
me to have not not pee

00:04:59.484 --> 00:05:03.254
Is there a way for me to get

00:05:03.254 --> 00:05:07.024
P from not not P will yes there

00:05:07.024 --> 00:05:10.793
is I can get P from not not

00:05:10.793 --> 00:05:14.563
pee by double negation elimination
online 5

00:05:15.723 --> 00:05:19.710
Now I have online six exactly the
sentence that

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.697
is on my show line online one I

00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:27.684
have proven what I set out to show

00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:30.831
So I can now enter my kiwi

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.649
D line and it is correct

00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:38.741
In this chapter the

00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:41.818
trickiest trick there is

00:05:42.104 --> 00:05:45.803
Is the trick of using double negation

00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:49.502
introduction and double negation
elimination as needed

00:05:49.502 --> 00:05:53.202
in order to massage the premises you

00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:56.901
have into the right form to then

00:05:56.901 --> 00:06:00.601
apply modus tollens do another premise
that

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:04.300
you have or to massage what

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.000
modus tollens spits out into the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.699
form that you need to complete

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.398
your derivation this is the biggest

00:06:15.398 --> 00:06:19.098
trick the hardest thing in this
