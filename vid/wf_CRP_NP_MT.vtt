00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.563
Brassed what follows by modus tollens

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:10.836
if our two premises are if

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:14.110
our than p and not-p

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.208
Well the way modus tollens works is one
of

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:22.217
your premises needs to be a conditional
in this

00:00:22.217 --> 00:00:25.226
case if our than p is our conditional

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:30.170
The other premise needs to be the
negation of

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.885
the consequent so the consequence of our
conditional promise

00:00:34.213 --> 00:00:35.829
ISpy

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:38.703
And our other premise is the

00:00:38.703 --> 00:00:41.144
negation of P not p

00:00:41.447 --> 00:00:44.622
And so what follows by modus

00:00:44.622 --> 00:00:47.798
tollens is the negation of the

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:50.973
antecedent in this case not our

00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:55.275
Are is the antecedent of our national
