00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Is nothing is allowed

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.860
In our scheme of abbreviation

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.400
Is allowed

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.730
Is represented by G

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.220
So we went

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.500
Nothing is G

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.160
There are two ways to go about handling nothing

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.930
You can either think of it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.970
Has

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.150
The negation of an existential

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.380
Generalization

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.050
Or you can think about it

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.060
As

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.980
A universal generalization of a negation

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.200
Let's start with the first

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.680
If this is the negation of an existential generalization

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.010
Then

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.940
It means that it's not the case

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.450
That something is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.100
G

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.430
So

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.930
Stop for a moment and just make sure that you see

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.610
But saying that nothing is allowed

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.820
Is the same as

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.290
Saying that it's not the case

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.660
But something is allowed

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.130
If something were allowed

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.200
Then it wouldn't be true that nothing is allowed

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.060
So

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.750
We deal with the knot

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.720
That's just a negation

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.700
The something is G

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.180
Is there is a tax

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.730
GX and I've got some extra practices in that I put in there just

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.200
Keep track of things in English

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.730
So we have it's not the case

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.500
But there is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.500
Some X

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.480
Such that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.600
X

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.470
Is G
