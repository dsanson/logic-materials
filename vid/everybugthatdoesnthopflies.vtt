00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.990
"Every but that doesn't hop flies":

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.990
This is a restricted universal generalization.
The Restriction is too bugs that don't hop.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.990
What we say about them is that they fly.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.990
So, "Every x is such that if it's a bug that doesn't hop then x flies".

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.990
We need to unpack "x is a bug that doesn't hop":

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.990
To say that "x is a bug that doesn't hop" is just to say that x is a bug AND x doesn't hop.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.290
'x doesn't hop' is just "not H(x)", so we have:

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:56.340
"Every x is such that if it's a bug and it doesn't hop then it flies"
