00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:09,207
This time or sentence is it rains if

2
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:13,108
it pours again I will replace the

3
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:16,575
Simple sentences with their sentence
letters

4
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:20,438
And I noticed that this time the
sentence T

5
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,942
is marked as the antecedent that is the
sentence

6
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:27,446
it pours is marked as the antecedent and
so

7
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,949
I need to come before the arrow it needs

8
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:34,453
to be the F part of the conditional the

9
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:37,957
first part of the conditional and are to
come

10
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:41,460
after the arrow since it's the
consequent the

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,964
part that supposed to follow from the
antecedent

12
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:48,757
Arrow are
