00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:06.095
Let me show you how to complete

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:09.563
your first translation exercise in
Carnap.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:13.570
What we have here is a sentence that we
need

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.194
to translate, that's the sentence in
English, and then it's

00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:20.819
been repeated again in this box, where we
can edit.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.066
And the sentence is 
'If parrots talk than quail talk'.

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:29.095
'If' is an antecedent marker: 

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:32.464
it marks the sentence 'parrots talk'

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.833
as the antecedent of this conditional. 

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.202
'Then' is a consequent marker,

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:42.571
marking 'quail talk' as the consequent.

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:47.042
I'm going to do this step-by-step.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:50.859
First, I replace the simple sentences with
their sentence letters,

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.675
following the scheme of abbreviation.
One thing I'm going

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:58.492
to do right now is I'm going to 
delete that period.

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:02.309
If I have that extra period, when 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.126
I'm done that will be a stray symbol that
Carnap

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:09.943
doesn't understand, and it'll say that
things are wrong.

00:01:09.943 --> 00:01:13.760
So make sure if there's a period at the end

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.576
of the English sentence to delete that.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:21.393
I need to replace 'if P then Q'

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:25.210
with the corresponding symbol in
sentential logic.

00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:29.003
And I want the 'if' part, which is P,

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.791
to come before the arrow,
and I want the 'then' part,

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.580
which is Q, to come after the arrow.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.369
To type in the arrow, since I don't have an


00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.157
arrow that I can type in on my keyboard,

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:47.946
I type hit the minus sign, '-',
followed by the greater than sign, '>'.

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:51.734
Carnap automatically
rewrites that to look like

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:55.523
a pretty arrow, not just like a minus
sign 

00:01:55.523 --> 00:01:59.311
cobbled together with a greater than sign. 
I'm now done.

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:03.100
If I click submit right now though,
it is going to complain.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.888
First Carnap wants me to check 
whether my answer is correct.

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:10.677
I do that by hitting 'enter'
or 'return'.

00:02:10.677 --> 00:02:14.465
When I hit 'enter' (or 'return'),
it says:

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:18.254
"Perfect match!" I then click 'OK', and now

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:22.042
the problem turns green with the nice
check mark,

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:25.831
to show me that I've correctly answered
the problem.

00:02:25.837 --> 00:02:29.792
I still then have to also click submit
in order to get credit for the problem.

00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:33.747
Make sure that you

00:02:33.747 --> 00:02:37.701
are submitting your work! 
When you do that you'll notice

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:41.656
that the number of the problem turns
green, 

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:45.611
and that your progress bar grows at the top of
the page.
