00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:07.773
This time we are asked: Suppose you have

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:12.171
'If P then Q' as a premise,

00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:15.916
and 'P' as your other premise.
What follows by Modus Ponens?

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:19.661
Modus Ponens is the rule that says that

00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:23.405
if you have a conditional as one of your
premises,

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:27.150
---here 'if P then Q'--- 
and you have its antecedent

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.895
as your other premise, here, 'P',
then you can

00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:34.640
infer the consequent, 'Q'. 
The answer here is 'Q'.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.385
An example of this would be if

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:42.130
the conditional premise said "if you're
happy then

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.875
you clap your hands", and if the other

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.620
premise, 'P', said "you are happy",

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.364
well, from those two pieces of information---

00:00:53.364 --> 00:00:57.109
if you're happy then you clap your hands,
and you are happy,


00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.854
it follows that you do clap your hands, 'Q'.
