00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:09.667
Tell again we start by

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.458
entering show and our conclusion

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:17.208
And then we indent and

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:19.972
we bring down our premises

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.157
I thought that you don't actually need

00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:33.954
to align your justifications it's they
just

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:37.752
need to be there on the line

00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:43.263
I will tend to align them early on in
this class

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:46.958
and as things get more complicated as
that becomes more

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.653
of a pain and I will probably stop
aligning them

00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:53.171
It's up to you how you want to do it

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:58.035
We need to get not pee we need

00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:00.868
to find a way to get not pee

00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:04.784
But there is no way to get not

00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:08.267
being one step we're going to need to

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:11.750
take two steps to complete this
derivation

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:15.345
The first step is to notice

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:18.494
that from 3 and 4

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:21.130
We can get not

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.189
Q by modus tollens

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:27.397
You're not seeing that remember modus
tollens

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:30.603
says if you've got a conditional

00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:34.497
And then you look at its consequent

00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:37.943
this case are and then your other

00:01:37.943 --> 00:01:41.389
premise is the negation of that
consequent

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:44.834
so not are then you're allowed to

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:48.280
infer the negation of the antecedent
though

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.725
not cute that's what we've done here

00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:57.959
That gives us line 5 to work with

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.925
in the sentence online 5 is not cute

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:06.317
If we look

00:02:06.317 --> 00:02:08.425
at line 2

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.942
Inline 5 we again have what

00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:16.714
we need to apply modus tollens

00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:21.032
This time it's modus tollens lines 2

00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:24.712
and 5 align5 is the negation of

00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:28.391
the consequent of line to modus

00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:32.071
tollens allows us to infer the

00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:35.751
negation of the antecedent of line

00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:41.662
And now we are done online 6 we have not

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:45.554
pee not pee is what we were trying to
prove

00:02:45.554 --> 00:02:49.445
not pee is what we set out to show

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:53.771
And so we need to enter our q.e.d. line

00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:56.808
So we out dent and we type in

00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:59.845
DD Line 6 because Line 6 is

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:02.882
where we got what we need it

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:04.651
That's it
