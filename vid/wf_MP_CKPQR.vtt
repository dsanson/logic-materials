00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:07.049
This time we have

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:12.929
the premise, 'P and Q arrow R',

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.233
'if both p and Q then R'. 

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:19.537
The other premise we have is 'P and Q'.

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.403
So 'P and Q' is the antecedent of 

00:00:23.403 --> 00:00:26.778
'If P and Q then R', so Modus Ponens

00:00:26.778 --> 00:00:30.152
allows us to infer the consequent, 'R'.
