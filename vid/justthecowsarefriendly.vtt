00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.510
Just the cows are friendly

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.400
Remember that for us

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.490
The word just has an importantly different meaning

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.410
Then the word

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.220
Homely

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.040
If I say only the cows are friendly

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.480
That means that the only friendly creatures

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.980
That you will find or among

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.230
The cows

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.800
So if someone is friendly they must be one of the cows

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.190
But it doesn't mean that all the cows are friendly

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.240
Suppose that you're at a farm

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.430
And the dogs are mean

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.340
And the Sheep are mean

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.960
And the goats are mean

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.710
And the farmer tells you

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.090
Only the cows are friendly

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.690
And so you approach a cow and the cow bites you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.330
And the farmer says

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.080
Oh

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.090
Not her she's not friendly

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.720
Not all of the cows are friendly

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.160
The farmer hasn't contradicted themselves

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.880
The Kent farmer said that only the cows are friendly

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.180
But didn't say that all of the cows are friendly

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.430
The other hand

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.470
For us the word just means

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.780
The same thing as exactly

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.210
So if the farmer says

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.900
Just the cows are friendly

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.570
The farmer is saying that exactly those things that are cows

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.770
Our friendly

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.250
In other words

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.710
Only the cows are friendly

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.900
But also

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.980
All the cows are friendly

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.710
So all-in-all only the cows

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.800
Our friendly

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.590
This is a biconditional

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.620
Inside of a universal

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.680
Generalization

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.160
So what this says is

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.620
Everything is such that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.170


00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.720


00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.080
It is a cow

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.040
If and only if it is

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.990
Friendly

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.220
To be a cow

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.140
His age

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.940
To be friendly

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.200
IS F

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.610
And remember the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.800
I double f

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.410
Is

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.880
Not a typo that's a shorthand for if and only if

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.080
Are biconditional

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.300
And everything is such that

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.410
Is our Universal quantifier

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.470
So

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.960
For all Acts

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.670
Sex is a cow

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.970
If and only if

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.350
Taxes friendly

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.740
In other words

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.390
The cows and the friendly creatures those two groups exactly coincide they have exactly the same members

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.400
So it's exactly the cows

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.520
That are friendly
