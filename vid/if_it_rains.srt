1
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:07,004
We have the sentence:
'if it rains, it pours.'

2
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:10,730
Replacing

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,456
the simple sentences with the sentence
letters,

4
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:18,182
I have 'if R', and recognize that the

5
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:21,908
'if' is marking 'R' as the antecedent.

6
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:25,634
So 'P' must be the consequent.

7
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:29,360
I replace 'if...then...' with 'â†’'.

8
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:31,127
And that's all.
