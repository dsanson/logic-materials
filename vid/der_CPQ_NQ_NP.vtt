WEBVTT

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.931
Our first derivation

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.608
So we always start a derivation

00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:14.786
by typing the word shell

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:18.098
Followed by the conclusion in

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:20.868
this case show not pee

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.569
It's important that you don't

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.784
start with a space

00:00:26.188 --> 00:00:29.926
That will confuse carnap to no end and
nothing

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:33.664
will work for you whenever type of space
just

00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:37.402
always the very first character on the
first line

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:41.140
to be that Capital ask for Joe not pee

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:45.329
On the next line you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.486
need to indent because line

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:51.642
one says I'm going to

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:54.799
show or prove not p

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:58.144
And now line to is the first

00:00:58.144 --> 00:01:01.415
line of my proof the first

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.686
thing I do on my way

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:07.956
to showing or proving not pee

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:11.809
Until I indent indicate that this is
something I'm

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:15.464
doing as part of that proof you can

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:19.120
indent with as many spaces or as few

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.776
spaces as you want one space is enough

00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:26.298
8 spaces you can also indent

00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:29.278
with a tab that will work

00:01:29.762 --> 00:01:33.733
Only thing that you need to be sure
about is

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.704
you need to be sure that you are
consistent you

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:41.674
need your indentations to be the same on
every

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:45.645
line or else car is likely to get very

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:49.616
confused so my first premise if P then Q

00:01:49.697 --> 00:01:52.100
And I'm going to type in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.504
my second promise not Q

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.045
And now I need to figure out if

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:02.610
there are any rules that I can apply

00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:04.585
Well

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:08.993
This is an opportunity to apply modus
tollens

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:12.921
my first premise online to is a
conditional

00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:16.849
and my other Primus online 3 is the

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.777
negation of its consequent so I can
infer

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:24.706
the negation of its antecedent and
that's by

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:28.634
modus tollens from lines 2 and 3

00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:32.078
I have now

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:34.092
completed my proof

00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:37.812
The last thing I need to do to

00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:41.532
finish this off is I need to enter

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:45.252
my qedn line-by-line explaining why what
I just

00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:48.972
did counts as showing what I set out

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:52.691
to show in the reason why what I

00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:56.411
just did counts as showing what I set

00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:00.131
out to just show is because line 4

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.352
As not pee on it and not pee

00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:06.154
was what I was trying to show

00:03:06.243 --> 00:03:09.583
So I out Dent to the point

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:12.923
where I'm now back aligned up with

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:16.264
that capital S on the first line

00:03:16.264 --> 00:03:19.393
And I am now entering the justifications
that

00:03:19.393 --> 00:03:22.523
starts with a colon this is a direct

00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:25.652
derivation so Dee Dee and I point the

00:03:25.652 --> 00:03:28.781
line for where I got what I needed

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:31.991
And that's what the derivation looks
like it let

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:35.001
me break this in a few ways just

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:38.010
to show you what happens when it breaks

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.949
So I mentioned that it's important that
your indentations be consistent so

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.889
if I out Dent line 3 by just a space
you'll

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.828
see that it no longer is showing as
correct and over

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:53.768
here there are some error messages that
if you hover over

00:03:53.768 --> 00:03:57.707
you can see it so here it says it looks
like

00:03:57.707 --> 00:04:01.646
you're citing a line which is not in
your sub proof

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:05.586
If you're not you may need to tidy up
your proof

00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:08.933
That's not the most transparent bit of
information

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:12.144
it'll make more sense to you after
you've

00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:15.356
done more divisions but what I'm saying
is

00:04:15.356 --> 00:04:18.568
that your indentations are messed up and

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:21.780
so it's confused about what's going on

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.611
It happens to it until also if I act do
this

00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:31.321
right night out Dent by Master I
invented by an extra

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:35.031
step that's also going to cause car not
to break

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:39.252
Occasionally there are things you can
get away

00:04:39.252 --> 00:04:41.989
with like if you just keep on out

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.592
Out dentyne more and

00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:46.154
more but you never

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.351
Bring it whenever you keep on adding
more spaces with

00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:54.611
each line rather than sometimes adding
more and sometimes nine

00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:57.872
less than carnap will be okay with that
but it's

00:04:57.872 --> 00:05:01.132
not going to look pretty. What you
should be doing

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.398
Another thing that sometimes people do

00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:06.675
is they add a space

00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:10.617
Between the colon and the rule and then
over here

00:05:10.617 --> 00:05:13.451
we have this warning message and it just
says I

00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:16.285
can't read that line there might be a
typo

00:05:16.731 --> 00:05:19.130
It doesn't understand because it expects
the rule

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.529
name to come right after the colon

00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:26.347
Another thing that people do is they
don't put any

00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:29.952
space between the rule numbers at the
real name in

00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:33.557
the line numbers and carnap is okay with
that

00:05:34.632 --> 00:05:38.231
You can also replace the, between the
line

00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:41.830
numbers with just a space that's fine

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:44.476
But if you don't put a, or a

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:46.757
space then it's going to be confused

00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:52.317
It says look you're depending on
something that's later

00:05:52.317 --> 00:05:56.165
on then your assertion what would they
mean is

00:05:56.165 --> 00:06:00.013
your siding line 23 but you're online
for

00:06:00.038 --> 00:06:01.792
So you can't do that

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:07.197
If you had a space there on the show
line

00:06:07.197 --> 00:06:10.630
that would break things so those are the
ways

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.063
you can break things sometimes people
forget to out

00:06:14.063 --> 00:06:17.496
sent their q.e.d. line and so then it
doesn't

00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:20.929
actually finish up you need to get that
all

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:24.361
the way out to the same level as the
