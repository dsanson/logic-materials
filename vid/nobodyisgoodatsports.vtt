WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
He is good at sports

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.550
This is a restricted

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.890
Negative

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.010
Generalization nobody just means no person

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.440
No person is good

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.700
At sports

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.190
When we symbolize

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.370
Or Translate

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.640
A negative

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.040
Restricted

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.250
Generalization

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.040
We always have a choice we can treat it

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.550
As a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.100
Restricted as the negation of a restricted existential generalization

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.120
Or we can treat it as a

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.000
Restricted Universal generalization

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.080
With a negative

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.770
Predicate

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.320
So let's do each of these in turn

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.150
No person is good at sports

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.270
We think of that as

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.750
It is not the case that some person is good at sports

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.970
Then we can treat some person is good at sports

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.690
In the way

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.840
That we have

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.910
Have been doing X's a person

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.460
And

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.670
Sex is good at sports

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.900
For some value of x

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.900
That's true you know X's a person is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.750
Paychex

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.680
Hexes good at sports

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.170
Is

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.260
Chi-x

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.290
This is end

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.200
And this is our existential quantifier so it's not the case

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.550
That there's

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.540
Something

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.590
That's both a person and good at sports

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.760
Another words nobody is good at sports

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.990
That's the first

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.460
Solution

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.050
And it is correct

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.960
But we can also treat nobody is good at sports as a universal generalization

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.490
Everything is such that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.050
If it is a person

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.190
Then it is good

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.060
Sports

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.840
Then it is good at sports than it is

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.950
Not good

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.960
That Sports

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.480
So

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.920
It is a person means

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.190
Hey Jax

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.570
It is not good at sports

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.040
He is not GX

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.760


00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.200
This is our conditional

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.150


00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.890
And this is our Universal quantifier

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.200
So for all Acts

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.060
If x is a person that X is not good at sports

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.640
Another way

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.110
Does expressing the claim

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.580
Nobody is good at sports and that is also

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.060
Correct
