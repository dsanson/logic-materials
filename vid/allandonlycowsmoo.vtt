00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
"All and only cows moo":

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.290
There are two ways to handle this.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.250
We could treat it as:


00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.320
"All cows moo and only cows moo".

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.840
If we do that, then we have

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.340
a conjunction of two restricted universal generalizations:

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.830
For all x (if it's a cow then it moves)

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.950
and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.190
For all x (if it moves then it's a cow).

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.880
So two restricted Universal generalizations,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.140
with conditionals inside, and it'll be the same conditional but going in opposite directions.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.620
But a more efficient way to symbolize this

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.910
is as the universal generalization of the biconditional,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.140

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.930

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.470
Everything is such that

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.750
it is a cow

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.380
if and only if it moos.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.420
Remember, the 'iff' isn't a typo;

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.050
It's shorthand for the biconditional

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.750
So that's the Double Arrow

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.090
To be a cow is 'H(x)'

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.200
To moo is 'M(x)

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.890
So everything is such that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.130
it's a cow if and only if it moves.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.550
All and only cows moo.
