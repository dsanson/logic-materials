00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
Don't mow

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:11.780
This is a restricted existential generalization it's making a claim about some cows in the claim it's making about them is that they don't move

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.520
So

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.120
The way we capture restricted existential generalizations

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.910


00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.050
Is

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.460


00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.960
Bye

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.900
Having a conjunction

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.950
Inside an existential generalization something is such that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.380
It is a cow

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.270
And it doesn't move

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.790
So for it to be a cow

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.930
Is H

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.590
And

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.220
It doesn't move

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.920
That's

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.240
Not

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.290


00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.720
So

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600
It is a cow and it doesn't move

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.750
Is Ajax and not MX

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.010
And this is our existential quantifier

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.710
So there's something

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.220
Such that

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.130
It is a cow and it doesn't move

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.940
Another words

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.240
Some cows don't know
