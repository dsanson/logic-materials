00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
Cows moo

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.400
This is a restricted

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.480
Negative generalization we're not saying that nothing moves

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.640
We're just saying that no cows moo

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.190
So

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400
We have two ways of handling

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.100
This

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.810
Sentence

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.090
One idea

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.470
Is to treat it as the negation of

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.620
The restricted existential generalizations if you think about

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.620
Some cows moo

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.350
What it takes for that to be true

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.280
And then you think about what it would be like if that was false if it was false that some cows moo

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.730
Well I guess that would be a world where the cows have all gone silent so no cows moo

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.210
So if we pursue this strategy

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.600
Some cows moo

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.180
Is

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.750
Something is such that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.570
It is a cow and it moves

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.880
So

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.840
It is a cow that's Ajax

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.590
It moves

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.190
That MX

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.330
Something is such that that's our existential quantifier so there's some Acts

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.830
Such that it is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.810
A cow and moves

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.150
If it least one cow mood

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.890
That would be true

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.390
So

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.010
Its negation

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.750
The claim that it's not the case

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.660
That there's at least one thing the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.460
It's both the cow and moose

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.430
Mean

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.840
That there is not out there even a single thing

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.040
What is a cow and moves the cows have all gone silent

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.850
No

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.630
Cows

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.750
But that is a correct answer

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.250
There's another way

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.220
To think of

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.160
Do cows move that is

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.240
Equivalent

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.320
Logically

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.980
But syntactically rather different

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.180
You can think of no cows moo is making a claim about all the cows

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.520
All cows moo makes the claim that all the cows moo

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.550
No cows moo

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.690
Makes the claim that all the cows

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.070
Don't move

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.420
So

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.700
All cows don't move

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.650
Every cow doesn't move

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.550
All cows don't move that's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.120
Cows don't move so that's all cows don't move that's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.040


00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.340
Everything

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.380
Is such that

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.470
If it is a cow

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.300
Then it doesn't move

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.760
So

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.610
It's a cow that a checks

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.950
It moves is MX so it doesn't move is not MX

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.650
This is a conditional

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.720
Everything is such that so that's are you

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.680
Universal

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.670
Quantifier for all Acts

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.340
Ex is a cow

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.560
Then

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.940
Ex does not move again

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.220
All the cows have gone silent

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.020
No cows moo

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.660
This captures the same idea

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.580
Just in a different way

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.160
That is also

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.340
A correct answer
