1
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:05,902
Our sentence is 'if (both parrots talk

2
00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:09,359
and quail talk) then robins talk.

3
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:13,534
I'm going to begin by replacing

4
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:17,252
the simple sentences with the
corresponding sentence letters

5
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:20,971
from the scheme of abbreviation.

6
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:26,059
I'm also going to delete that final period,

7
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,953
so that doesn't end up there,

8
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:31,847
and I don't notice it at the very end.

9
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:35,571
Now I need to replace

10
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:38,496
the logical connectives in English with

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,420
the corresponding connectives in
sentential logic.

12
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:45,404
I'm going to start from the inside and
work my way out.

13
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:48,860
Or as the reading sometimes puts
it

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,316
I'm going to start with the least main
connective,

15
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:55,772
which is 'both...and...', and then work my way

16
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,228
out to the main connective, which is
'if...then...'.

17
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:03,040
The 'Both P and Q': that is

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,713
a conjunction of P and Q.

19
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:08,385
I'm going to delete the 'both',

20
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:12,181
and I'm going to replace the 'and'
with the conjunction symbol.

21
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:15,760
And the way to enter the conjunction
symbol

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,338
with your keyboard is by typing a forward
slash,

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,592
followed by a backslash. 

24
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:27,454
Carnap will redraw that,
to look nice for you.

25
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:31,621
And now I am going to replace 'if...

26
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:35,412
then...' with the arrow:
that's a minus sign, '-', 

27
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:39,203
followed by the greater than sign, '>'.
There are other shortcut keys

28
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:42,995
that Carnap will recognize.

29
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:46,786
The caret symbol, '^', which you can get

30
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:50,578
by typing shift-6 on your keyboard:

31
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,369
it will recognize that has a conjunction.

32
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,160
but it won't draw it as pretty,
and it's actually no easier

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,952
to type that than it is to

34
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:05,743
type the forward slash followed by the
backlash.

35
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:09,529
Now I'm going to hit 'enter' to verify

36
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,308
that I have the right answer.
Actually, before I do that

37
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:17,087
let me put that period back.
Suppose I had forgotten

38
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:20,866
(to delete it) and had left the period there.

39
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:24,646
I hit enter, and it says:

40
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:28,425
"Sorry try again. That formula isn't
grammatical." That error

41
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:32,204
means that Carnap doesn't understand the
syntax of my sentence,

42
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:35,983
and that's because there's this extra period.
If my answer was just wrong,

43
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:39,763
I would get a different
error message.

44
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:43,542
Just to give you an example,
suppose that I had

45
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:47,321
snuck a negation in there, and I had 
'(P ∧ Q) → ¬R',

46
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:51,101
and then I hit 'enter'.

47
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:54,880
Carnap says "Not quite! Try again. 

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,659
So if the error message says 
"that sentence is not grammatical",

49
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,438
that means that you either have a symbol


50
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:06,218
that isn't part of our vocabulary,
like a stray period.

51
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:09,652
Or it means that you might have an extra

52
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:13,081
parentheses or missing parentheses. 
Or you have done something else,

53
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:16,509
that Carnap cannot parse as a
sentence. 

54
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:19,938
If it can parse the sentence,
but your answer is wrong,

55
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:23,366
Carnap will say what it just said:

56
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:26,795
"Not quite! Try again."

57
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:30,852
Now I hit "enter", and it says "Perfect match!"
cuz that's the right answer.

58
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:34,423
if I was doing this as an actual
assignment, I would 

59
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,994
click "submit", in order to be sure to get
credit for the problem.
