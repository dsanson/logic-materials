00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
But everything happens for a reason

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.370
The first

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.430
He's out there

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.560
In our scheme of abbreviation is o

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.900
And happens for a reason or scheme of abbreviation is H

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.370
So nothing is over but everything is H

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.210
This is a conjunction

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.600
Of

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.300
Sweeping generalizations

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.750
I remember the word but

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.970
In English is just another way of saying

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.940
And

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.400
I'm going to first just go ahead and replace that

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.810
With the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.570
The end

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.580
Everything is hok

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.190
For all Acts

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.050
Paychex

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.860
That's how we deal with everything is Gage

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.240
Nothing is up here we have a choice

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.010
Probably the simplest thing to do

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.490
Is this a that it's not the case

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.270
That something

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.970
Is o

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.520
The other option

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.660
Is it supposed lent is you can say that everything is not okay

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.880
Both of those

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.390
Capture the thought that nothing is up so if everything is not

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.310
Oh

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.970
Well then nothing is a hoe

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760
And if it's not the case

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.000
That

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.010
Something is okay

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.340
Could not the case that even at least one thing is so

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.750
Then nothing is out

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.500
Both of those answers are correct
