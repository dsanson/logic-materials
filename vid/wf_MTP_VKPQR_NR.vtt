00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.930
What follows by MTP from these two premises????

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:17.050
The first premise is a disjunction either (all of this) or R.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.260
The second premise says not R

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.550
So that means that the other disjunct must be the one that's true.
