00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
"All cows moo."

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.960
This is a restricted universal generalization.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.380

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.520

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.280
The way we capture restricted universal generalizations

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.780
is by paraphrasing them

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.060
in terms of a conditional:

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.470
'All cows moo'

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.660
is the same as 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.100
'everything is such that if it is a cow then it moos'

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.920
'cow' is H(x)'

00:00:34.950 -->  00:00:38.800
to moo is 'M(x)'.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.180
So:

00:00:40.750 -->  00:00:44.470
'If it is H then it is M'

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.550
And that's true of everything,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.950
so 'for all x, if x is H then x is M'

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.640
For all x,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.280
if x is a cow, then x moos.
