00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:08,097
Our sentence is 
'I smile just in case I laugh'.

2
00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:12,043
'I smile' is P,
'I laugh' is Q.

3
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:15,989
So we have 'P just in case Q'.

4
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:19,934
'just in case' is another way of

5
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:23,880
expressing the biconditional:
it says that P obtains

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,825
in exactly those situations in which Q
obtains,

7
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:33,969
P is a necessary and sufficient
condition for Q.

9
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,830
We render that that with 
the double arrow, 'â†”'.
