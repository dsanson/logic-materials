00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.580
Our conclusion is BOTH NOT G(c) AND G(d). 
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:17.590
I find it it's easier to think about if I make it a bit more concrete:

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:27.590
So our conclusion is: CARL IS NOT GREEN AND DEONTAY IS NOT GREEN.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:37.590
Our premise is EVERYTHING IS NOT GREEN:

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:47.590
'FOR ALL y, y IS NOT GREEN'. From that premise,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.590
we can INSTANTIATE, since it says EVERYTHING IS NOT GREEN we can infer that ALEX IS NOT GREEN;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:07.590
we can infer that BERNICE IS NOT GREEN and so on.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:17.260
But if we just keeps inferring random instances, then we're not going to make good progress.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.730
Our conclusion is about CARL and DEONTE.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.830
So instead of inferring ALICE IS NOT GREEN,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:34.860
let's infer CARLE IS NOT GREEN, and that DEONTAE IS NOT GREEN.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:44.860
Given those to facts, we can join them together, to get:

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.500
CARL IS NOT GREEN AND DEONTAY IS NOT GREEN, which is our conclusion.
