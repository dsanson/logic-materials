00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:07.818
This time we have:

00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:13.741
'not not (all this other stuff)'
as a premise.

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:18.057
And we are asked, what follows by 
Double Negation Elimination.

00:00:18.057 --> 00:00:22.049
Well, those two negations at the front

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:26.042
are negating the whole big thing
inside the parentheses.
00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:30.034
What follows by Double
Negation Elimination is:

00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:34.002
everything that was inside the

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.970
parentheses, without that double negation.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:42.619
I've gone ahead and dropped the
outermost parentheses,

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:46.469
because they are not needed.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.666
It is also perfectly right

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.863
like that
