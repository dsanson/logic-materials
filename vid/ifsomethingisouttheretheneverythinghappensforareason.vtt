00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
If something is out there then everything happens for

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.700
For a reason

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.270
So

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.950
He is out there

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.260
In our scheme of abbreviation is just is 0

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.560
And

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.940
Happens for a reason

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.920
Is

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.860
Hage

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.650
So

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.090
Something is 0ven everything is H

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.940
The main connective of this sentence

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.640
Is the conditional it says

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.000
If

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.080
Something is hell

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.400
Then

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.670
Everything is H

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.850
As far as something is ogos

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.010
That means

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.390
That there's some X

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.970


00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.150
Such that

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.580
OLX

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.210
And as far as everything is H

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.090
Goes

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.220
That means that

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.760
Every EX

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.420
Is such that h x

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.950
And now just

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.980
Rendering those quantifiers

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.210
In our symbols

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.600
We have

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.860
If there is some axe

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.400
Such that o x

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.770
Then

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.310
Every X is such that h x
