The question asks us what follows by simplification from "P AND R"

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:20.110
So you have this premise "P AND R",

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:30.110
which says that both P is true and Q is true, so one thing that follows by simplification from P AND R

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.230
is just P by itself.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.510
Another equally good answer is that R follows from P AND R.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.830
And those are the two correct answers.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.560
