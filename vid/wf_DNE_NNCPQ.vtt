00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.942
Here we are asked if we have 

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.844
"not not both P and Q" as a premise,

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.747
what follows by Double Negation Elimination?

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:18.939
So, this is our premise.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.943
Double Negation Elimination simply

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:24.947
says that we can delete or eliminate

00:00:24.947 --> 00:00:27.950
two negations at the front of a sentence.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:31.337
So the sentence that we

00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:34.148
are allowed to infer by

00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:36.959
DNE is just "P and Q".
