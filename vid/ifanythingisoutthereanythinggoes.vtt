00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Is out there than anything goes

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.970
So

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.540
The first thing to notice is that this is

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.070
The conditional

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.770
And the antecedents and consequences are both sweeping generalizations

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.340
So

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.680
Anything is out there

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.700
Then

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.050
Anything Goes

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.120
Now

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.920
Here's where things get tricky

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.180
As the reading says

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.070
Hennything is kind of a trickster word

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.290
In some context anything means

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.170
Everything

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.610
And in other contexts

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.150
Anything means

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.450
Something or at least one thing

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.890
So

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.810
Here

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.280
Where it says anything goes so

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.380
If anything is out there than anything goes

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.390
If you think about what's meant here

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.200
Pretty clear

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.790
That this means

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.250
Everything

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.130
Goes

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.430
Everything is allowed

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.380


00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.530


00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.160
Which

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.860
In our

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.430
Steve abbreviation is

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.070
Everything is G

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.940
If anything is out there that doesn't mean if

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.040
Everything is out there

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.900
It means that if there's something out there

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.600
Then everything

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.950
Goes

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.300
So here this is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.620
Something

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.080
Is out there is 0/0

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.850
So

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.590
If something is older than everything is G

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.800
If you aren't sure whether that's right

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.260


00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.470
I don't have

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.550
A secret

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.650
Story to tell about why that's right

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.430
I just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.850
Would ask you

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.130
To think about what that sentence means in English

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.940
You're a fluent speaker of English

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.660
So you have a sense of what that sentence means

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.920
And

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.540
As a fluent speaker of English

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.480
The question for you is

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.160
Given what that sentence means in English how can we represent it in PL

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.580
And

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.410
In order to represented in pl we really have to treat the first anything as meaning something

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.390
And the second anything is meaning everything

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.280
So from here it's pretty straightforward

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.140
Something is out there means that there's at least one thing that is 0

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.410
And

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.690
Everything goes means that for all things

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.940
Lego

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.120
And we

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.000
Have our answer to the problem

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.680
Like I say

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.910
Anyting

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.870
Is a very tricky word
