What follows by MTP from these two premises? The first premise

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:18.410
is EITHER Q OR NOT P. The second premise says that Q is false.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.900
So we know that either Q is true or not P is true, and we know that it isn't Q that is true.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.020
So what follows is NOT P
