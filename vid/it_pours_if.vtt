00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:05.486
Our sentence is it

00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:07.584
pours if it rains

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:11.921
I replace it pours with P I

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:15.606
replace it rains with r and I'm

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:19.292
left with P if our if Mark's

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:22.977
what comes after it namely the sentence

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:26.662
it rains or are as the antecedent

00:00:26.662 --> 00:00:30.347
and that means that's the thing that

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:34.033
comes before he must be the

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.718
consequent cuz there's nothing marking
it

00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:40.073
So this is a conditional

00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:45.020
But it isn't going to be

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.988
the conditional Iero our if I

00:00:48.988 --> 00:00:52.957
have it be the conditional ProAir

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:56.925
that makes it pours the antecedent

00:00:56.955 --> 00:01:00.364
But I want it rains to be

00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:03.773
the antecedent so I need to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.509
Make my answer be if our then P

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.798
if it's the are before the arrow and

00:01:11.798 --> 00:01:15.088
the P after the arrow now are it

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:18.377
rains is the antecedent and pee and
porous

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:21.666
is the consequent which fits with the
English

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.550
And that's the answer
