00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.990
"Every bug other than Charlotte and Barry B. Benson hops."
This is a restricted Universal generalization.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.920
The sweeping generalization would be "Everything hops".

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:25.960
The restriction is to bugs other than Charlotte and Barry.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:35.960
Let's put the restriction in parentheses for a moment.
If this was just everything hops,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:45.960
then it would be 'FOR ALL x H(x)'

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:55.960
We restrict universal generalizations by adding an antecedent to a conditional:

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:05.960
"FOR ALL x, IF x IS A BUG OTHER THAN CHARLOTTE AND BARRY THEN x HOPS". 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:15.960
What's left is to unpack the restriction: the thing has to be a bug,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:25.960
and it has to be other than Charlotte and Barry.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:35.960
So has to be a bug and be other than Charlotte and Barry.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.960
Other than Charlotte is 'not identical to Charlotte (¬x=c)'
and other than Barry is 'not identical to Barry (¬x=b)'

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:55.960
So here is our translation: 'Everything is such that

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:05.960
if it's a bug and it's not Charlotte and it's not Barry then it hops'

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.360
