00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.536
I'm sentence is if

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:08.573
it pours it rains

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:13.021
So I will start by replacing it

00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:16.303
pours with the sentence letter P and

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:19.586
it rains with the sentence letter r

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.397
I have f p e r

00:00:23.652 --> 00:00:27.550
If Mark's p is the antecedent

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:31.697
Are isn't marked by anything that's
because in this

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:35.472
sentence there could be a helper word
then

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:39.247
marking the are as a consequent but
whoever

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:43.022
wrote this being lazy decided to delete
or

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.797
omit the helper word and just say if

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:50.572
it pours it rains assuming that you are

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:54.347
the reader would be able to figure out

00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:58.122
that the part that is not marked it

00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:01.897
rains must be the consequent so I'm
canonical

00:01:01.897 --> 00:01:05.672
English this would be if P then our

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:09.142
And so now my job is just

00:01:09.142 --> 00:01:12.479
to replace the English connective if men

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.817
with the logical connective of the

00:01:15.817 --> 00:01:19.154
arrow and that is the answer
