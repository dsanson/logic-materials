00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:05.902
Our sentence is 'if (both parrots talk

00:00:05.902 --> 00:00:09.359
and quail talk) then robins talk.

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:13.534
I'm going to begin by replacing

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:17.252
the simple sentences with the
corresponding sentence letters

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:20.971
from the scheme of abbreviation.

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:26.059
I'm also going to delete that final period,

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.953
so that doesn't end up there,

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:31.847
and I don't notice it at the very end.

00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:35.571
Now I need to replace

00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:38.496
the logical connectives in English with

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:41.420
the corresponding connectives in
sentential logic.

00:00:41.948 --> 00:00:45.404
I'm going to start from the inside and
work my way out.

00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:48.860
Or as the reading sometimes puts
it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.316
I'm going to start with the least main
connective,

00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:55.772
which is 'both...and...', and then work my way

00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:59.228
out to the main connective, which is
'if...then...'.

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:03.040
The 'Both P and Q': that is

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.713
a conjunction of P and Q.

00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:08.385
I'm going to delete the 'both',

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:12.181
and I'm going to replace the 'and'
with the conjunction symbol.

00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:15.760
And the way to enter the conjunction
symbol

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.338
with your keyboard is by typing a forward
slash,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.592
followed by a backslash. 

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:27.454
Carnap will redraw that,
to look nice for you.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.621
And now I am going to replace 'if...

00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:35.412
then...' with the arrow:
that's a minus sign, '-', 

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:39.203
followed by the greater than sign, '>'.
There are other shortcut keys

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:42.995
that Carnap will recognize.

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:46.786
The caret symbol, '^', which you can get

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:50.578
by typing shift-6 on your keyboard:

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:54.369
it will recognize that has a conjunction.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.160
but it won't draw it as pretty,
and it's actually no easier

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.952
to type that than it is to

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:05.743
type the forward slash followed by the
backlash.

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:09.529
Now I'm going to hit 'enter' to verify

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.308
that I have the right answer.
Actually, before I do that

00:02:13.308 --> 00:02:17.087
let me put that period back.
Suppose I had forgotten

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:20.866
(to delete it) and had left the period there.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:24.646
I hit enter, and it says:

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:28.425
"Sorry try again. That formula isn't
grammatical." That error

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:32.204
means that Carnap doesn't understand the
syntax of my sentence,

00:02:32.204 --> 00:02:35.983
and that's because there's this extra period.
If my answer was just wrong,

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:39.763
I would get a different
error message.

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:43.542
Just to give you an example,
suppose that I had

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:47.321
snuck a negation in there, and I had 
'(P ∧ Q) → ¬R',

00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:51.101
and then I hit 'enter'.

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:54.880
Carnap says "Not quite! Try again. 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.659
So if the error message says 
"that sentence is not grammatical",

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.438
that means that you either have a symbol


00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:06.218
that isn't part of our vocabulary,
like a stray period.

00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:09.652
Or it means that you might have an extra

00:03:09.652 --> 00:03:13.081
parentheses or missing parentheses. 
Or you have done something else,

00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:16.509
that Carnap cannot parse as a
sentence. 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.938
If it can parse the sentence,
but your answer is wrong,

00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:23.366
Carnap will say what it just said:

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:26.795
"Not quite! Try again."

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.852
Now I hit "enter", and it says "Perfect match!"
cuz that's the right answer.

00:03:30.852 --> 00:03:34.423
if I was doing this as an actual
assignment, I would 

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:37.994
click "submit", in order to be sure to get
credit for the problem.
