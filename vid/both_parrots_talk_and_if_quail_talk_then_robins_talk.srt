1
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:06,822
Your sentence is 'Both parrots talk and

2
00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:10,578
(if quail talk than robins talk)'.

3
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,025
I'm going to follow the same process.

4
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,748
I'm going to first replace the

5
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:19,472
simple sentences with their sentence
letters.

6
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:32,789
I'm going to delete that period.

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:39,478
I have 'both P and (if Q then R)'.

9
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,398
I'm going to work my way from the

10
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:46,787
inside out. So I'm going to replace:

11
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:50,176
'if Q then R' with 'Q → R'...

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,792
And I'm going to replace 

13
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:58,703
both the 'both' and the 'and'

14
00:00:58,703 --> 00:01:01,588
with the conjunction sign, '∧'.

15
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:04,532
And I am now done! I hit enter

16
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,860
and it tells me if that is correct.

17
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:10,216
If I were doing this as an

18
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,915
actual assignment, I would now hit submit

19
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:15,614
in order to submit it for the assignment.
