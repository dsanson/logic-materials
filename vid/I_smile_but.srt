1
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:06,189
Our sentence is 
'I smile but I don't laugh'

2
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:09,966
'I smile' is P in our scheme
of abbreviation.

3
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:13,743
 'I don't laugh' is the negation

4
00:00:13,743 --> 00:00:17,521
of 'I laugh', which is Q in our

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:21,298
scheme of abbreviation. So:
'P but not Q'.

6
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:25,075
'But' is a stylistic variant of 'and': 

7
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:28,852
'but' means the same thing as 'and'.

8
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:32,629
So we symbolize 'but' just as a conjunction.
