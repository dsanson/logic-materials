1
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:06,351
Our sentence is people talk if

2
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:09,347
and only if rumors spread

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,292
I replace people talk with p and I

4
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:16,714
replace rumors spread with r and I am

5
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:20,136
left with P if and only if r

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,101
If and only if is are canonical English

7
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:27,762
way of expressing the biconditional the
Double Arrow

8
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:31,423
and so I'm going to replace this now

9
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:35,085
with the Double Arrow the type in the

10
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:38,746
Double Arrow and type the less-than
symbol followed

11
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:42,407
by the minus sign followed by the
greater

12
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:46,068
than symbol and carnap will do that

13
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:49,729
for me as a nice Double Arrow
