00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:09.207
This time or sentence is it rains if

00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:13.108
it pours again I will replace the

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.575
Simple sentences with their sentence
letters

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:20.438
And I noticed that this time the
sentence T

00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:23.942
is marked as the antecedent that is the
sentence

00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:27.446
it pours is marked as the antecedent and
so

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:30.949
I need to come before the arrow it needs

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.453
to be the F part of the conditional the

00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:37.957
first part of the conditional and are to
come

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:41.460
after the arrow since it's the
consequent the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.964
part that supposed to follow from the
antecedent

00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:48.757
Arrow are
