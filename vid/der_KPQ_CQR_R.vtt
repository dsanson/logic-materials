00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.090


00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:11.410
We have a derivation, our conclusion is R and are two premises are "P AND Q"

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.980

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.230
and "IF Q THEN R".

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.460

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.000
Ultimately we'd like to be able to do MODUS PONENS with line 3. But to do MODUS PONENS with line 3,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:37.030
we need to have Q on a line by itself, and we don't have that right now. 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.350
So keep that in mind.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:48.360
Looking at 2, it's a conjunction. Our new rule SIMPLIFICATION says that when you have a conjunction, 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:58.360
you can break it apart into its two pieces. When we do that we end up with both P on a line by itself,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.140
and Q on a line by itself.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.690
Remember, Q is what we needed

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:11.300
to do MODUS PONENS with line 3, so now we can do that...

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.050


00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.980
And that gets us R

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.730


00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.860

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.800

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.120

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.670
And I have a DIRECT DERIVATION.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.620


00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.030

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.440
Notice that I never used line 4.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.830
So it is possible to make this derivation shorter,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.150
and to only simplify line 2 only once, to get Q.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.300
(mumbles as I notice that I wrote down the wrong line numbers)

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.900
And that's fine too.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:06.930
There are no extra points for creating the shortest possible derivation! 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.020
When you have a conjunction, go ahead and simplify and get both parts,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.910
so that you can see what, if anything, you're able to do with them.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.010
