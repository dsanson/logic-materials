00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.320
Our sentence is

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.070
Everything is allowed

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.020

Is allowed

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.670
Is g x so we went to say that for every X

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.290

The choice of variables in all of these problems is arbitrary

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.940

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.420

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.220
What matters is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.940
Let the quantifier

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.280
Is binding that variable it doesn't matter

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.060
Which variable I choose

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.860
To use
