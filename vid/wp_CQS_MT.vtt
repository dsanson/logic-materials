00:00:06.018 --> 00:00:09.008
Our premise is ifcu the nests and

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.999
the question is what other premise do

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.989
we need to apply modus tollens

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:17.920
Well

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.087
In order to apply modus tollens

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.907
we need the negation of the

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:26.728
consequent of our conditional premise

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:29.888
Consequence of our conditional

00:00:29.888 --> 00:00:32.004
premise is s

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.502
So the negation of that

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.674
consequence would be not s
