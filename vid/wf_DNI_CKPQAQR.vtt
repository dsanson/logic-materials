00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:08.332
The question asks, suppose you have 

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.029
"If P and Q, then Q or R" as a premise.

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.726
What follows from that, 

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:19.422
by Double Negation Introduction?

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:23.119
First, we need to put those parentheses around

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.187
the whole thing is, which was

00:00:28.187 --> 00:00:31.133
written in informal notation.

00:00:32.462 --> 00:00:34.777
If you like, we can also put

00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:37.092
parentheses around the "P and Q"

00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:40.659
and the "Q or R", since, remember,

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.626
"ands" and "ors" group more 
tightly than "arrows".

00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:46.816
And then we double negate

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:49.345
that whole thing. So two negations in front.

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:53.891
That's the correct answer. 
You don't need all those parentheses! 

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:57.526
You don't need the parentheses around
the "P and Q" 

00:00:57.693 --> 00:01:01.298
and the "Q or R", because 
our convention

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:04.904
tells us that inside here,

00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:08.509
the and and the or group more tightly
than the arrow.
