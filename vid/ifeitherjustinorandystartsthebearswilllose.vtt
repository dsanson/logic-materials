00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.810
Our sentence is, "if either Justin or Andy starts the Bears will probably lose."

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.800
The comma tells us that there should be a big break there.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.160
Also, the use of a

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.610
complex subject here, Justin or Andy,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.070
tells us that this

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.960
"Justin or Andy starts" should work together as a unit. 

00:00:20.150 -->  00:00:24.930
So, I am going to put in some parentheses...

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.860
And now I am oing to go ahead and replace the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.470
sentences with their sentence letters,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.790
So, "Justin starts" (P),

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.160
or "Andy starts" (Q),

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.750
And the consequent here is:

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.360
"the Bears will probably lose" (R)....

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.000
We have "Either P or Q",

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.220
(P ∨ Q)

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.490
And so we have if that

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.810
then R: (P ∨ Q) → R

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:08.820
And that's our sentence.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.320
If we like we can remove these parentheses, 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.610
Since our conventions tell us that 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.970
the "∨" groups more tightly than the "→"
