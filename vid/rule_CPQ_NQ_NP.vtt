00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:09.313
So are two promises are if

00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:13.054
P then q and not Q

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.899
The question is what rule

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.442
Is this an instance of what rule

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:23.564
allows us to infer from those two

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:26.685
premises to our conclusion not pee

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.783
The answer is this is modus tollens
modus tollens

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:33.904
is the rule that says that if you've

00:00:33.904 --> 00:00:37.026
got a conditional promise like we do
here

00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:40.417
And then you have on another

00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:43.588
line the negation of the consequent

00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:46.386
We can infer the

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:48.459
negation of the antecedent

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:51.360
And I need to say that I'm applying

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.480
but as felons two lines one and two
