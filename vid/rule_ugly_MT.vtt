00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:09.576
But this one looks like a nasty mess but

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:13.334
let's just go ahead and work our way
through

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:17.092
it so we have as our first promise me

00:00:17.092 --> 00:00:20.850
and Q if p and Q then not r

00:00:21.184 --> 00:00:22.833
Heroes

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:27.195
I dropped some parentheses there that
weren't needed our conventions tell us

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:31.155
that since this is a arrow and an end
that the end

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:35.115
groups more tightly so I can mention
Stella just read this

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:39.075
as though there are parentheses around
the p in the queue

00:00:39.077 --> 00:00:42.216
If you are more comfortable having those
parentheses

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:45.355
there by all means keep them there it's

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:48.494
optional you can do it either way

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:51.633
that's our premise or second premise is

00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:56.891
Not not our heroes

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.349
And the question is

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:04.999
What rule can we apply to

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.926
those two premises in order to

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:10.852
get the conclusion and Q

00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:13.681
What's the rule

00:01:14.228 --> 00:01:16.802
Well if you look

00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:19.376
at our two premises

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.573
One of them is a

00:01:22.573 --> 00:01:25.139
conditional promise online one

00:01:25.883 --> 00:01:29.188
The other one online 2

00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:33.975
Is the negation of the consequent

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:37.702
of line 1 line 2 is

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:41.430
the consequence of line one

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.158
with an extra negation added

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:49.351
So that's what we need to apply modus
tollens

00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.830
and if we apply mother's talent and we
have

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.309
the negation of that consequent it's
going to

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:59.787
spit out the negation of that antecedent
which

00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:03.266
is exactly what we have as our
conclusion

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:06.745
so this is another instance of modus
tollens

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:09.305
1 + 2
