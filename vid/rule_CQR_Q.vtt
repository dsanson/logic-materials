00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:08.767
We need to apply our rule to

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.981
these two premises in order to get

00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:15.196
the conclusion are so we need

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:18.410
to show how this is an

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.625
instance of our rule modus ponens

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:25.126
The first we type in the first premise

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.249
And then we indicate that it's a

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.349
premise by typing in Colon ER

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:35.760
Then we type in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.938
our second premise Q

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.627
And we indicate that it's a

00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:43.034
premise again with colon PR

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:48.461
Finally we say that from those two

00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:51.978
lines we can infer are by modus

00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:55.496
ponens and the way that I typed

00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:59.014
that out is first are and then

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:02.531
colon MP4 modus ponens and then the

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:06.049
two line numbers that I'm applying the

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.567
rule two lines one and two
