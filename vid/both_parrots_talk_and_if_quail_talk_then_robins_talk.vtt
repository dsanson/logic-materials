00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:06.822
Your sentence is 'Both parrots talk and

00:00:06.822 --> 00:00:10.578
(if quail talk than robins talk)'.

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:14.025
I'm going to follow the same process.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.748
I'm going to first replace the

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:19.472
simple sentences with their sentence
letters.

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:32.789
I'm going to delete that period.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:39.478
I have 'both P and (if Q then R)'.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.398
I'm going to work my way from the

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:46.787
inside out. So I'm going to replace:

00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:50.176
'if Q then R' with 'Q → R'...

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.792
And I'm going to replace 

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:58.703
both the 'both' and the 'and'

00:00:58.703 --> 00:01:01.588
with the conjunction sign, '∧'.

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:04.532
And I am now done! I hit enter

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:06.860
and it tells me if that is correct.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:10.216
If I were doing this as an

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.915
actual assignment, I would now hit submit

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:15.614
in order to submit it for the assignment.
