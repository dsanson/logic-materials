00:00:02.624 --> 00:00:06.187
Our sentence is 
'I don't react unless I smile'

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:09.751
'I smile' in our scheme abbreviation

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:13.314
is P. 'I don't react' is the

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:16.877
negation of R, 'I react'. 

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:20.441
So we have '¬R unless P'.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.358
'unless' is a stylistic variant of 'or'.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:29.216
It means the same thing as 'or'.

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:33.074
Now you might not believe this.
The reading talks about it.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:36.931
It talks about another way

00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:40.789
of handling 'unless', using a
conditional and a negation.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.647
But if you do that, there's

00:00:44.647 --> 00:00:48.504
a very good chance that you will

00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:52.362
get the order of things wrong!
The simplest and easiest and

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:56.220
most surefire way to symbolize
'unless', 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.078
without getting into any trouble,
or making any mistakes

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:03.127
is to symbolize it as 'or', '∨'.
