00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:08.097
Our sentence is 
'I smile just in case I laugh'.

00:00:08.097 --> 00:00:12.043
'I smile' is P,
'I laugh' is Q.

00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:15.989
So we have 'P just in case Q'.

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:19.934
'just in case' is another way of

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:23.880
expressing the biconditional:
it says that P obtains

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.825
in exactly those situations in which Q
obtains,

00:00:28.248 --> 00:00:33.969
P is a necessary and sufficient
condition for Q.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.830
We render that that with 
the double arrow, 'â†”'.
