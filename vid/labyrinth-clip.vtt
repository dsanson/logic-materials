00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.200
It's not fair!

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.260
That's right!

3
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.820
It's not fair!

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.520
But that's only half of it.

5
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.720
This was a dead end a minute ago.

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.020
No! That's the dead end, behind you!

7
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.980
It keeps changing! What am I supposed to do?

8
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.920
Well, the only way out of here is to try one
of these doors.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.079
One of them leads to the castle at the center
of the Labyrinth, and the other one leads

10
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.620
to---bum bum bum bum---certain death!

11
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.020
Oooooooh!

12
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.660
Which one is which?

13
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.000
Eh, we can't tell you.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.040
Why not?

15
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.160
Um, we don't know!

16
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.500
But they do.

17
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.530
Oh, then I'll ask them.

18
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
Um, no, you can't ask us.

19
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.210
You can only ask one of us.

20
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.460
This is the rules.

21
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.580
And I should warn you that one of us always
tells the truth and one of us always lies.

22
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.320
That's (?), he always lies.

23
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.320
I do not!

24
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320
I tell the truth!

25
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.350
Oooh, what a lie.

26
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.060
He's the liar!

27
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.760
Alright, answer yes or no.

28
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.300
Would he tell me that this door leads to the
castle?

29
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.740
Uh...yes.

30
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.860
Then...the other door leads to the castle
and this door leads to certain death.

31
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.240
Oooh!

32
00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:28.299
How do you know?

33
00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.069
He could be telling the truth.

34
00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.130
But then you wouldn't be, so if you tell me
that he said yes, I know the answer is no.

35
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.289
But I could be telling the truth.

36
00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.920
But then he would be lying.

37
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.310
So if you tell me that he said yes, I know
the answer would still be no.

38
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.639
Wait a minute, is that right?

39
00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:43.639
I don't know!

40
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.680
I've never understood it!

41
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.900
No, it's right.

42
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.960
I figured it out.

43
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.200
I could never do it before.

44
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.920
I think I'm getting smarter!

45
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.940
This is a piece of cake!
