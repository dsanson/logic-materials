1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,885
A sentence is a long one this time it's
not the

2
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:10,869
case that if your friends don't dance
you can't dance

3
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:14,548
Now make this a little bit easier to
track

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,694
I'm going to just replace the it is

5
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:20,841
not the case that with our negation sign

6
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:25,115
But we have not if your friends don't
dance

7
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:28,914
you can't dance no really important
thing to

8
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:32,713
understand is that when you have a
phrase

9
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:36,512
like it is not the case that if

10
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,770
The negation cannot leap over

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,473
the F in order to

12
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:46,177
do things inside the conditional

13
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:50,131
Negation is stuck outside the
conditional

14
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:53,584
the overall form we have here

15
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:57,037
is it's not the case that

16
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:02,129
This conditional is true. Let's look at
that

17
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,811
conditional so your friends don't dance
that is

18
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:09,492
not pee and you can't dance that

19
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:13,173
is not far so what we have

20
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,854
is a conditional and the antecedent is

21
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:20,536
not pee your friends don't dance and

22
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:24,217
the consequent then is not our you

23
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,898
can't stand so we will delete the

24
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:31,580
English and replace it with the arrow

25
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:35,275
So that is what that symbolic sentence
means

26
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,788
it is the negation of the claim

27
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:42,301
that if not me then not are

28
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,814
so the way we say that out

29
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,327
loud is it is not the case

30
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,840
that if not P then not r
