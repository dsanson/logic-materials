00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:12.540
The question asks, what is something that follows by simplification from "not P and not Q".

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:22.540
Simplification is the simplest of all possible rules: it just says that if you have an AND statement,
a conjunction, you're allowed to infer either conjunct.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:32.540
So, you're allowed to infer not P by itself, so that's a correct answer. And you are also allowed to infer not Q by itself.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.090
So that's also correct.
