00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.740
Something is allowed

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.190
He is allowed in our scheme of abbreviation

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.140
Is

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.040
G

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.390
So

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.890
We're saying that something is G

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.270
To say that something is G is to say that some X

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.420
Is such that X

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.570
Is G

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.520
So we get the X's G

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.860
Like so

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.420
And then that's our quantifier

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.120
There is an axe

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.500
GX

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.820
Is a shorthand way

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.050
Love saying that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.760
Out loud
