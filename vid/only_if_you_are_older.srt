1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,922
My sentence is only if you are

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,964
older than 11 can you legally drive

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,076
You are older than 11 is q

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,471
You can legally drive is

5
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:19,637
so the form of our

6
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:22,803
sentence is only if

7
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:25,969
Q now only if

8
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:29,901
Is a consequent marker so it marks the

9
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:33,693
sentence that comes after it Q you are

10
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:37,485
older than 11 as the consequent so that

11
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:41,278
means that we want you to become after

12
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:45,070
the arrow as the consequent and we won

13
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:49,602
To come before the arrow only if you are

14
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:53,219
older than 11 can you legally drive is
just

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,836
another way of saying that if you can

16
00:00:56,836 --> 00:01:00,453
legally drive then you are older than 11

17
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:04,070
those two sentences to say the same
thing
