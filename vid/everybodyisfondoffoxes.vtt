00:00:00.020 -->  00:00:01.710
'Everybody is fond of of foxes'

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.390
Again this is a restricted generalization.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.220
This time it's a restricted universal generalization

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.700
'Everybody'

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.890
just means 'every person',

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.920
'Every person is fond of foxes'

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.320
The way we deal with

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.440
Restricted universal generalizations

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.400
Is by surrounding a conditional

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.440
with a universal generalization, so 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.320
'Everything is such that (if it's a person

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.110
then it is fond of foxes)

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.620
'It is a person' is 'H(x)'

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.860
'It's fond of foxes' is 'F(x)'

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.090
'If...then...' is the conditional.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.350
And this is our universal quantifier,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.730
'For every x (

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.500
if x is a person,


00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.330
then x is fond of foxes)'
