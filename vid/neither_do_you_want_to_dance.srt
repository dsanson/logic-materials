1
00:00:02,626 --> 00:00:05,271
Our sentence is neither do you want

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,915
to dance nor can you dance

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,508
This is a neither nor that

4
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:14,708
you wanted to dance is q

5
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:18,183
And you can dance is

6
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:21,125
are so the sentences the

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,067
same neither Q nor are

8
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:28,223
There are two ways that are equally

9
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:32,109
good to symbolize the neither nor
statement

10
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:35,996
one way of symbolizing it captures the

11
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:39,883
idea that if neither Q nor are

12
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:43,769
that means both of those claims

13
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:47,656
are not true to say that

14
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:51,542
both of those claims are not

15
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:55,429
true is to say both not

16
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:59,316
q and not hard that is

17
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:03,766
Not Q

18
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:08,450
Are joined together

19
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:12,567
Conjunction

20
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,918
That is a correct answer

21
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,622
The other way to

22
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:23,375
symbolize neither he nor

23
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,128
you neither Q

24
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,747
Nor are

25
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,496
Is it follows the idea that if neither

26
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:37,801
one is true that means that it's

27
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:41,107
not the case that either one is

28
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,594
Then we're sayingNot.

29
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,987
Either one not

30
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:51,005
or are

31
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:55,201
I am so in that case we have a negation
out front

32
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:57,756
Of a disjunction and

33
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,869
that is also correct

34
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:04,062
You might notice that sometimes carnap
will say that one of

35
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:07,736
the answers is correct and other times
it'll say that it's

36
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:11,410
a perfect match when I create these
problems and carnap it

37
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,084
asked me what answer I think is the
right answer and

38
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:18,758
it says perfect match when the answer
that you give is

39
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:22,432
exactly the one that I typed it and it
says correct

40
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:26,106
when the answer that you give is
logically equivalent to the

41
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:29,781
one that I typed in in this case both of
these

42
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:33,455
answers are equally good it just happens
to be that this

43
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:37,129
is the one that I typed into the answer
key
