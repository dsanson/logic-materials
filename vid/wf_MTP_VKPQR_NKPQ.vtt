What follows by MTP from these two premises? This time our first premise is a disjunction,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:20.310
"EITHER P AND Q OR R"  and our sceond is premise is the negation of that first disjunct, 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:30.310
as the premise says "IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT BOTH P AND Q". Since we know that IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT BOTH P AND Q

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.220
It must be R that is true.
