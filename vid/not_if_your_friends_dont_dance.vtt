00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.885
A sentence is a long one this time it's
not the

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:10.869
case that if your friends don't dance
you can't dance

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:14.548
Now make this a little bit easier to
track

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:17.694
I'm going to just replace the it is

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:20.841
not the case that with our negation sign

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:25.115
But we have not if your friends don't
dance

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:28.914
you can't dance no really important
thing to

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:32.713
understand is that when you have a
phrase

00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:36.512
like it is not the case that if

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.770
The negation cannot leap over

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.473
the F in order to

00:00:43.473 --> 00:00:46.177
do things inside the conditional

00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:50.131
Negation is stuck outside the
conditional

00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.584
the overall form we have here

00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:57.037
is it's not the case that

00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:02.129
This conditional is true. Let's look at
that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.811
conditional so your friends don't dance
that is

00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:09.492
not pee and you can't dance that

00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:13.173
is not far so what we have

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.854
is a conditional and the antecedent is

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:20.536
not pee your friends don't dance and

00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:24.217
the consequent then is not our you

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:27.898
can't stand so we will delete the

00:01:27.898 --> 00:01:31.580
English and replace it with the arrow

00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:35.275
So that is what that symbolic sentence
means

00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:38.788
it is the negation of the claim

00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:42.301
that if not me then not are

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.814
so the way we say that out

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:49.327
loud is it is not the case

00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:52.840
that if not P then not r
