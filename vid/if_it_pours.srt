1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,536
I'm sentence is if

2
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:08,573
it pours it rains

3
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:13,021
So I will start by replacing it

4
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:16,303
pours with the sentence letter P and

5
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:19,586
it rains with the sentence letter r

6
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:23,397
I have f p e r

7
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:27,550
If Mark's p is the antecedent

8
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:31,697
Are isn't marked by anything that's
because in this

9
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:35,472
sentence there could be a helper word
then

10
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:39,247
marking the are as a consequent but
whoever

11
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:43,022
wrote this being lazy decided to delete
or

12
00:00:43,022 --> 00:00:46,797
omit the helper word and just say if

13
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,572
it pours it rains assuming that you are

14
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:54,347
the reader would be able to figure out

15
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:58,122
that the part that is not marked it

16
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:01,897
rains must be the consequent so I'm
canonical

17
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:05,672
English this would be if P then our

18
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:09,142
And so now my job is just

19
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:12,479
to replace the English connective if men

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,817
with the logical connective of the

21
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:19,154
arrow and that is the answer
