00:00:04.484 --> 00:00:06.743
The time we're asked: Suppose

00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:09.001
we have "if P arrow Q"---

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:13.079
---sorry "if P arrow Q or R"---
as our premise,

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.379
"if P then either Q or R",

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.679
what follows by Double Negation
Introduction?

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.240
So again we need to remember

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.339
to put those outer parentheses in,

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:29.973
and then we just
double negate our premise,

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:33.908
And that is the answer.
