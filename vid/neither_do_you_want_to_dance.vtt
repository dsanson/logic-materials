00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:05.271
Our sentence is neither do you want

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.915
to dance nor can you dance

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.508
This is a neither nor that

00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:14.708
you wanted to dance is q

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.183
And you can dance is

00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:21.125
are so the sentences the

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.067
same neither Q nor are

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:28.223
There are two ways that are equally

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:32.109
good to symbolize the neither nor
statement

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.996
one way of symbolizing it captures the

00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:39.883
idea that if neither Q nor are

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:43.769
that means both of those claims

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.656
are not true to say that

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:51.542
both of those claims are not

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:55.429
true is to say both not

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.316
q and not hard that is

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:03.766
Not Q

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:08.450
Are joined together

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:12.567
Conjunction

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.918
That is a correct answer

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.622
The other way to

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:23.375
symbolize neither he nor

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:27.128
you neither Q

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.747
Nor are

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.496
Is it follows the idea that if neither

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:37.801
one is true that means that it's

00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:41.107
not the case that either one is

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:45.594
Then we're sayingNot.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.987
Either one not

00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:51.005
or are

00:01:51.784 --> 00:01:55.201
I am so in that case we have a negation
out front

00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:57.756
Of a disjunction and

00:01:57.756 --> 00:01:59.869
that is also correct

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:04.062
You might notice that sometimes carnap
will say that one of

00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:07.736
the answers is correct and other times
it'll say that it's

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:11.410
a perfect match when I create these
problems and carnap it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.084
asked me what answer I think is the
right answer and

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:18.758
it says perfect match when the answer
that you give is

00:02:18.758 --> 00:02:22.432
exactly the one that I typed it and it
says correct

00:02:22.432 --> 00:02:26.106
when the answer that you give is
logically equivalent to the

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:29.781
one that I typed in in this case both of
these

00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:33.455
answers are equally good it just happens
to be that this

00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:37.129
is the one that I typed into the answer
key
