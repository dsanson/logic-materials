00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:09.040
What follows by MTP from the premises, EITHER Q OR P, and NOT P?

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:19.120
Since you know that either Q or P must be true, at least one of those must be true.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:27.900
And P is false because NOT P is true.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.870
What follows is that Q is true.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.290
