00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:06.067
Our sentence is you can legally drive
only

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:09.544
if you are older than 11 Consulting

00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:13.022
our game of abbreviation we see that

00:00:13.022 --> 00:00:16.499
you can legally drive is p you

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.977
are older than 11 is Q so

00:00:19.977 --> 00:00:23.454
our sentence is p only if Q

00:00:23.887 --> 00:00:25.984
As the reading explained

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:28.110
Only f

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:32.856
In English is a consequent marker so so

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:36.570
far we've been looking at sentences
where if

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.284
marks the sentence that comes right
after it

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:43.998
as the antecedent but only does the
opposite

00:00:43.998 --> 00:00:47.712
of that it marks the sentence that

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:51.426
comes right after it as the consequent

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:54.991
And so that means that you should

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.111
be the consequence of this conditional
which

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.231
means that pee which is unmarked must

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:04.350
be the antecedent so only if

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:08.567
The be replaced with the arrow having p

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:12.467
as the antecedent and you as the

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:16.366
consequence since Q was marked as
consequent
