00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:10.080
As always, to translate into canonical English we work from the outside in.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.920
So first,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.640
I replace the quantifier phrase with

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:28.430
its canonical English, "Every x is such that (F(x) and G(x))."

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:38.320
Next I'm going to replace what's inside the parentheses. I replace the main connective, which is the conjunction

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.300
with its canonical English, so...

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:53.370
I replace this with "(both F(x) and G(x))". Continuing the process,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.690
I replace the predicates with their canonical English,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.880
"x a fox" and "x is a goose".

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.050
Finally, I want to consider whether I can replace my "x"s 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.800
with pronouns without introducing ambiguity.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.360
In this case, I can. What I get is:

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:39.890
"Everything is such that both it is a fox and it is a goose".

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.760
If you think about what that means,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.590
we can keep going and we try to say that in yet more idiomatic English:

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.260
"Everything is both a fox and a goose",

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.680
Or, "Everything is a fox and goose".

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.630
That doesn't seem like something that's likely to be true,
but that's what that symbolic sentence says when translated into canonical English.
