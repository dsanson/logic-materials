00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.190


00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:11.220
The question asks what follows by simplification from this conjunction. The main connective is the AND
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:21.220
in the middle, and simplification tells us that when we have a conjunction, we are welcome to infer

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:31.220
either conjunct, so one correct answer is "IF P THEN Q". Another equally correct answer

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:41.220
is "IF Q THEN P". Both of those follow from the conjunction, 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.750
"BOTH IF P THEN Q AND IF Q THEN P"
