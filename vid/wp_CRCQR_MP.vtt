00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:09.141
The premise is

00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:13.649
If our Arrow Q then r

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:17.009
In the question asks what other premise

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.072
do we need to apply MP

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.293
In order to apply MP the other premise
we

00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:28.519
need is the antecedent of our
conditional permit

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:32.345
In this case it's a little

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:35.454
bit confusing because our premise are

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:38.563
are oak you are or

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.307
As two conditionals in it

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:45.695
But the main connective in this premise
is that second

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:49.333
arrow that can do it was the main
connective

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.080
That's the connective that tells us
about

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.711
the overall structure or form of this

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.877
In the antecedent of that conditional
then

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:04.284
is its if all of this stuff

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:07.692
is true if if our then

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:11.099
Q is true then ours true

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:14.786
Define modus ponens we need the
antecedent

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:17.984
of our conditional promise which in this

00:01:17.984 --> 00:01:21.182
case is just if are they
