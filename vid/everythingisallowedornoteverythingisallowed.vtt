00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
Or not everything is allowed

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.470
Remember in our scheme of abbreviation

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.180
Is allowed

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:07.890
Is

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.500
Chief

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.420
So everything is G or not everything is G

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.810
This is a disjunction of two

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.910
Sweeping generalizations

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.140
Everything is G

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.180
That's

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.990
His again

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.250
For all X

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.270
Chi-x

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.750
And there's a negation there so we have

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.980
Heider

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.910
Everything is G

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.810
Or

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.080
Not

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.890
Everything is
