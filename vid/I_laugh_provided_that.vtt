00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:04.907
Our sentence is:

00:00:04.907 --> 00:00:07.262
I laugh provided that I smile.

00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:10.730
'I laugh' is P.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.550
'I smile' is Q. 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.370
So we have 'P provided that Q'.

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.594
'Provided that' is a stylistic
variant of 'if'.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:24.338
So this means the same thing as 'if'.

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:28.081
That means that 'provided that'
is marking 'I smile'

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.824
as the antecedent, in just the

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:35.567
way that 'if' can mark

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:39.310
'I smile' as the antecedent. 
that

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.053
So our answer is 'Q â†’ P': 

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:46.797
If Q, 'I smile', then P, 'I laugh'.
