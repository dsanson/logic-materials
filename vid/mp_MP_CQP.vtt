00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.218
You have "Q arrow P" as your premise, 

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:12.596
"if Q then P". The question asks what
other

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:15.975
premise you need to apply Modus
Ponens.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.924
To apply Modus Ponens, the other premise
you need

00:00:19.924 --> 00:00:23.218
is always the antecedent of your
conditional,

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:26.513
that is, the part that comes before the arrow,

00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:29.807
the "if" part. So in this case 'Q'

00:00:29.807 --> 00:00:33.101
would be the other premise you would
need.

00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:34.127
