00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.480
As always, when translating from

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.070
symbolic logic to canonical English,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.430
we work from the outside in, which means that we start by identifying the main connective,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.110
and rendering that into canonical English, and then we go from there.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.910
So in this case, the main connective is the conjunction, 'and'.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.750
And to make this strictly canonical, we actually say,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.340
"Both that and that".

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.560

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.150

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.070
Our next step is to consider

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.550
what the main connective is of this part. The main connective is 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100

the quantifier phrase, so: "Some x is such that".

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.870
And the main connective of this part is this quantifier phrase,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.140
"Every y is such that"

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.480

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.970
Now we have to replace the predicates:

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.280
"x is a fox"

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.900


00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.090
And,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.500


00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.900
"y is a goose."

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.200


00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.780
So here's our sentence:

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:45.080
"Both some x is such that x a fox and every y is such that y is a goose"

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.260
Can we replace our variables with pronouns?

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.190

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.740
We get:

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.980
"Both something is such that it is a fox

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.170
and everything is such that it is a goose."

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.280
Do you see the problem here with the "it"s?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.730
This 'it' goes back to 'something' and the other 'it' should go back to 'everything'.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.290
But it's possible somebody might misunderstand,
and think that it goes back to 'something'.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.980
So we've introduced to potential ambiguity.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.160
We can go one step further,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.420
and eliminate this ambiguity,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.650
with the simpler "both something is a fox and everything is a goose"
