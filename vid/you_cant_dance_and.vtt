00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.516
Our sentence is you can't dance and

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:08.322
it is not safe to dance

00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:12.412
So I'm going to replace you can't dance

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:16.135
with the negation of you can dance so

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:19.859
you can dance is our and so you

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.582
can't dance is not our since we don't

00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:27.306
have the negation symbol on our keyboard
we

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:31.029
will use the tilde to type in a

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.753
negation until December is usually above
your tab

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:38.476
key on the left hand side of your

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:42.200
keyboard and just underneath your Escape
key

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:46.932
You can't dance and it is not safe to
dance

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:50.884
that is the negation of it is safe to

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.836
dance which is s so that is not s

00:00:55.902 --> 00:00:58.659
And finally the

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.415
conjunction and is

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.172
best and Junction

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.329
You can't dance and it is

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.919
not safe to dance is translated

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:15.509
into not are and not s
