1
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:06,355
Our sentence is: 'Although I don't smile,

2
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:10,098
I do react.' So 'I don't smile' is the

3
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:13,840
negation of 'I smile', which is P.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,583
'I react', or 'I do react' is R. 

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:21,326
So our sentence is 'Although not P, R'.

6
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:25,068
'Although' is a stylistic variant 
of 'but' or 'and'.

7
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:28,811
It has this additional feature: 

8
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:32,554
you can put 'although' at the 
beginning of a conjunction,

9
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:36,296
or in the middle of the conjunction.

10
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:40,039
English doesn't doesn't care!

11
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,640
So this sentence is rendered as:
'¬P ∧ R'.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,471
Think about the sentence,
and what it takes 

13
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:52,302
for it to be true: it has to be true that

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,132
I don't smile, and it also has to be true

15
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:59,963
that I do react. So, 
although I don't smile...

16
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,031
I do react.
