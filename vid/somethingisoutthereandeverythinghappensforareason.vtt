00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
Out there and everything happens for a reason

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.280
In our scheme of abbreviation is out there

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.560
Is

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.540
Oh

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.880
And happens for a reason

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.000
Is

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.190
Hage

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.290
I'm going to replace

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.660
Something is out there with something as though

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.540
And

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.980
Everything happens for a reason with everything is 8

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.410
The main connective of this sentence is the conjunction

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.420
The end

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.920
It's conjoining two sweeping generalizations

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.750
On the left hand side

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.150
We have some X

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.270
Is such that

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.960
Hex is how

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.740
Out there

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.260
And on the white right-hand side we have

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.900
Every why

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.310
Is such

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.200
B y happens for

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.170
For a reason

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.230
I could choose other variables here

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.660
What matters is not which variables I use

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.390
But which quantifier

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.130
Phrases

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.340
Buying twitch

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.080
Variables

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.670
Some Acts

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.950
Is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.460
Backwards e x

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.080
And

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.390
Every why is upside down a y

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.360
And so that is my answer
