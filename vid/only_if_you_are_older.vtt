00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.922
My sentence is only if you are

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.964
older than 11 can you legally drive

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.076
You are older than 11 is q

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:16.471
You can legally drive is

00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:19.637
so the form of our

00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:22.803
sentence is only if

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:25.969
Q now only if

00:00:26.108 --> 00:00:29.901
Is a consequent marker so it marks the

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.693
sentence that comes after it Q you are

00:00:33.693 --> 00:00:37.485
older than 11 as the consequent so that

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:41.278
means that we want you to become after

00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:45.070
the arrow as the consequent and we won

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:49.602
To come before the arrow only if you are

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:53.219
older than 11 can you legally drive is
just

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.836
another way of saying that if you can

00:00:56.836 --> 00:01:00.453
legally drive then you are older than 11

00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:04.070
those two sentences to say the same
thing
