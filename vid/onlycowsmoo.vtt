00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
Smell

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.260
This is also a restricted Universal generalization

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.080
But it's not the same as all cows moo

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.680
Rather

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.290
It's the same as all mooers are cows

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.250
We can paraphrase only cows moo

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.780
As

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.540
Everything is such that

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.520
Only if

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.710
Is a cow

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.480
Does it move

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.810
Now

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.580
Only if it is a cow

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.150
Does it mu

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.920
Only if marks the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.130
Cow

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.140
Has the consequent

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.770
So the moon must be the antecedent so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.660
Is

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.240
Equivalent to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.450
If

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.390
It moves

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.760
Then

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.410
It is a cow

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.270
So we have everything is such that if it moves

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.280
Then it is a cow

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.080
New is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.570
M

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.360
Cow is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.810
Hey h

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.640
So

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.980
That's a conditional

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.920
And we have the universal quantifier out front

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.560
So this says

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.320
For every X If It Moves then it's a cow

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.570
And if you think about that

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.010
That says the same thing as

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.590
Only cows moo

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.800
Everything that moves is a cow those are equivalent
