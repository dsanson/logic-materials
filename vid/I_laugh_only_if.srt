00:00:03,633 -->  00:00:10,713
Our sentence is 'I laugh only on
the condition that I smile.'

3
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:14,254
'I laugh' is P, 'I smile' is Q.

4
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:17,794
So 'P only on the condition that Q'.

5
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:21,542
'On the condition that' is another

6
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,822
way of saying 'if', a stylistic

7
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:28,102
variant of 'if'. So this sentence is

8
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:31,381
equivalent to: 'P only if Q'.

9
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:35,664
'Only if' marks what comes after it,
in this case, Q,

10
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:39,581
as the consequent---the thing that
should come after the arrow.

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,499
So in this case I can simply
replace

12
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:47,416
'only if' with 'â†’', and I have:

13
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,334
'if P---if I laugh---then Q---then I smile.
