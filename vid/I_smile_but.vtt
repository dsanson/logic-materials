00:00:02.412 --> 00:00:06.189
Our sentence is 
'I smile but I don't laugh'

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.966
'I smile' is P in our scheme
of abbreviation.

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:13.743
 'I don't laugh' is the negation

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:17.521
of 'I laugh', which is Q in our

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:21.298
scheme of abbreviation. So:
'P but not Q'.

00:00:21.298 --> 00:00:25.075
'But' is a stylistic variant of 'and': 

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:28.852
'but' means the same thing as 'and'.

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:32.629
So we symbolize 'but' just as a conjunction.
