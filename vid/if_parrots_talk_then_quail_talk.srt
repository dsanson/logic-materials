1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:06,095
Let me show you how to complete

2
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:09,563
your first translation exercise in
Carnap.

3
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:13,570
What we have here is a sentence that we
need

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,194
to translate, that's the sentence in
English, and then it's

5
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:20,819
been repeated again in this box, where we
can edit.

6
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:25,066
And the sentence is 
'If parrots talk than quail talk'.

7
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:29,095
'If' is an antecedent marker: 

8
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,464
it marks the sentence 'parrots talk'

9
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:35,833
as the antecedent of this conditional. 

10
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,202
'Then' is a consequent marker,

11
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:42,571
marking 'quail talk' as the consequent.

12
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:47,042
I'm going to do this step-by-step.

13
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:50,859
First, I replace the simple sentences with
their sentence letters,

14
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,675
following the scheme of abbreviation.
One thing I'm going

15
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:58,492
to do right now is I'm going to 
delete that period.

16
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:02,309
If I have that extra period, when 

17
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,126
I'm done that will be a stray symbol that
Carnap

18
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:09,943
doesn't understand, and it'll say that
things are wrong.

19
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:13,760
So make sure if there's a period at the end

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,576
of the English sentence to delete that.

21
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:21,393
I need to replace 'if P then Q'

22
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:25,210
with the corresponding symbol in
sentential logic.

23
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:29,003
And I want the 'if' part, which is P,

24
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:32,791
to come before the arrow,
and I want the 'then' part,

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,580
which is Q, to come after the arrow.

26
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,369
To type in the arrow, since I don't have an


27
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,157
arrow that I can type in on my keyboard,

28
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:47,946
I type hit the minus sign, '-',
followed by the greater than sign, '>'.

29
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:51,734
Carnap automatically
rewrites that to look like

30
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:55,523
a pretty arrow, not just like a minus
sign 

31
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:59,311
cobbled together with a greater than sign. 
I'm now done.

32
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:03,100
If I click submit right now though,
it is going to complain.

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,888
First Carnap wants me to check 
whether my answer is correct.

34
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:10,677
I do that by hitting 'enter'
or 'return'.

35
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:14,465
When I hit 'enter' (or 'return'),
it says:

36
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:18,254
"Perfect match!" I then click 'OK', and now

37
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:22,042
the problem turns green with the nice
check mark,

38
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:25,831
to show me that I've correctly answered
the problem.

39
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:29,792
I still then have to also click submit
in order to get credit for the problem.

40
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:33,747
Make sure that you

41
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:37,701
are submitting your work! 
When you do that you'll notice

42
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:41,656
that the number of the problem turns
green, 

43
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:45,611
and that your progress bar grows at the top of
the page.
