00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.234
The question asks suppose you have 

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:10.847
"If P then Q" as a premise, 

00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:14.461
what follows from that,
by Double Negation Introduction?

00:00:15.013 --> 00:00:18.322
Our premise is "P arrow Q"

00:00:20.862 --> 00:00:24.611
You might think what follows is

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:27.606
the double negation of that, '¬¬P→Q'.

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:31.306
The mistake here is that the

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:33.975
sentence that we just typed,
'¬¬P→Q',

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:39.010
is a sentence in informal notation,
and strictly speaking,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.772
it has parentheses on the
outside.

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:47.213
When you put in those parentheses,
'(¬¬P→Q)', you can see 

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.488
that what you really did was 
double negate the 'P'.

00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:53.762
You didn't double negate the conditional,
'if P then Q'.

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:57.606
So what we need is

00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:01.215
parentheses around the 'P arrow Q',

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.374
with a double negation out
front, like that.
