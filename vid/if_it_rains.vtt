00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:07.004
We have the sentence:
'if it rains, it pours.'

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.730
Replacing

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.456
the simple sentences with the sentence
letters,

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:18.182
I have 'if R, P', and recognize that 

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:21.908
the 'if' is marking 'R' as the antecedent.

00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:25.634
So 'P' must be the consequent.

00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:29.360
I replace 'if...then...' with 'â†’'.

00:00:29.573 --> 00:00:31.127
And that's all.
